# Project Description
This project is a 3D scene created using C++ and OpenGL. The scene features a 3D building and a 3D bicycle, with various color models and transformations applied to these objects. The project demonstrates the use of key and mouse inputs to interact with the objects in the scene.
# Features
The project includes the following features:
1. 3D Scene Objects:
   - A 3D building with 2 floors, a roof, one door, and four windows.
   - A 3D bicycle.
2. Color Models:
   - Suitable colors are applied to each object in the building.
   - The background color is set to green.
   - The 3D bicycle is colored black.
3. Automatic Bicycle Movement:
   - The bicycle moves in a circular path around the building.
   - Use the mouse left button to enable the animation, causing the bicycle to start rotating around the building.
   - Use the mouse right button to disable the animation.
4. Camera Control:
   - Adjust the camera to view the 3D scene from different directions using the following keys:
     - x to move left.
     - Shift + x to move right.
     - y to move down.
     - Shift + y to move up.
     - z to zoom out.
     - Shift + z to zoom in.
5. Building Transformations:
   - Use the key 'o' to open the door at a suitable angle.
   - Use the key 'c' to close the door at a suitable angle.
   - Use the key 'O' to open the windows at a suitable angle.
   - Use the key 'C' to close the windows at a suitable angle.
6. Bicycle Transformations:
   - Use the key 'f' to move the bicycle forward along the X-axis.
   - Use the key 'b' to move the bicycle backward along the X-axis.
   - Use the key 'r' to rotate the right wheel at a suitable angle.
   - Use the key 'l' to rotate the left wheel at a suitable angle.

# Usage 
- Use the keys 'o', 'c', 'O', 'C' to open and close the door and windows of the building.
- Use the keys 'f', 'b', 'r', 'l' to move and rotate the bicycle.
- Use the mouse left button to enable the bicycle animation.
- Use the mouse right button to disable the bicycle animation.
- Adjust the camera to view the scene from different angles.
