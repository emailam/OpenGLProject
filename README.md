# Project Description
This project is a 3D scene created using C++ and OpenGL. The scene features a 3D building and a 3D bicycle, with various color models and transformations applied to these objects. The project demonstrates the use of key and mouse inputs to interact with the objects in the scene.
# Features
The project includes the following features:
1. 3D Scene Objects:
   - A 3D building with at least 2 floors, a roof, one door, and four windows.
   - A 3D bicycle.
2. Color Models:
   - Suitable colors are applied to each object in the building.
   - The background color is set to green.

3. Automatic Bicycle Movement:
   - The bicycle moves in a circular path around the building.
   - Use the mouse left button to enable the animation, causing the bicycle to start rotating around the building.
   - Use the mouse right button to disable the animation.
4. Camera Control:
   - The camera coordinates can be controlled to view the 3D scene from different directions.
# Usage 
- Use the keys 'o', 'c', 'O', 'C' to open and close the door and windows of the building.
- Use the keys 'f', 'b', 'r', 'l' to move and rotate the bicycle.
